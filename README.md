# yackage

Package your Node.js project into an executable.

This project is targeted for apps built with [Yue library][yue] and
[Yode Node.js runtime][yode].

## Install

```
npm i -g yackage
```

## Usage

```
Usage: yackage [options] [command]

Options:

  --platform <platform>     Target platform
  --arch <arch>             Target arch
  --yode-version <version>  Yode version
  --app-dir <dir>           Path to the app
  --cache-dir <dir>         Directory to store downloaded binaries

Commands:

  build <outputDir>         Build executable file from app
  dist <outputDir>          Build and create distribution
  install                   Download Yode for current platform
  start                     Run app with Yode
```

Note that by default yackage would download Yode binaries into the `yode/`
directory under the app's directory, make sure `yode/` is added to `.gitignore`
otherwise it would be included in the final executable. Or you can explicitly
pass `--cache-dir` to specify the place to sotre downloaded Yode binaries.

## Examples

Generate executable from the app under current working directory (You should add
`out/` to `.gitignore` to avoid including `out/` into the executable):

```sh
cd /path/to/app/
yackage build out
ls out
```

Generate executable from path under arbitrary path:

```
yackage build out --app-dir /path/to/app
```

Generate executable for arbitrary platform:

```
yackage build out --platform win32 --arch ia32
```

Generate distributions:

```
yackage dist out --app-dir /path/to/app
```

Download Yode and start your app with it:

```
yackage install
yackage start
```

## Configuration

Currently a very limited subset of [electron-builder][electron-builder]
configuration is supported.

The `electron-builder` is a great tool for packaging apps, but it is also very
specific for Electron. I wish to be able to reuse the project to package Yode
apps, or add Yode support to `electron-builder` directly, but I'm not really
familiar with its source code to do that.

## How yackage works

1. Run `npm pack` to generate tarball for the app.
2. Extract the tarball to temporary directory and run `npm install`.
3. Use `asar` to package the app and its dependencies.
4. Append the generated ASAR archive to Yode.
5. Yode would automatically recognize the ASAR archive appended in the
   executable and start with it.

### Differences from packaging in Electron

By default yackage would unpack the `.node` files so they are not extracted
dynamically when running, otherwise anti-virus softwares would complain.

The unpacked files are placed in the `res` directory instead of the usual
`.unpacked` directory, so the final distribution would look more formal.

The `.js` files are compressed with `uglify-es` by default.

The virutal root directory of ASAR archive is `${process.execPath}/asar`. Using
`process.execPath` as virutal root directory directly would confuse Node.js
since it should be a file.
